### Maximum Triplet Sum

Given an array of n integers, find maximum triplet sum in the array without duplicates.

Notes:
* Array size is at least 3.
* Array numbers could be a mixture of positives, negatives also zeros.
* Repetition of numbers in the array could occur, so duplications are not included when summing, (i.e) the numbers added only once.

```javascript
maxTripletSum ([-7, 12, -7, 29, -5, 0, -7, 0, 0, 29]); // returns 41
```
Explanation:
As the triplet that maximize the sum `[12 , 29 , 0]` in order, their sum is 41.
